### Implementation Notes & Tips for LinkedIn Focus

* **Post format**: On LinkedIn, upload the video *natively* if possible—not just the YouTube link. Native LinkedIn video performs better because it auto-plays and retains audience on platform. ([Social Media Dashboard][1])
* **Hook & captions**: Because many LinkedIn users watch with sound off, include large on-screen text and closed captions early (first 3–6 seconds) to grab attention. ([Social Media Today][2])
* **Length & format**: Ideally keep the LinkedIn version concise (under 2 minutes) or create a shorter excerpt from your full YouTube video to post on LinkedIn, with a clear call to action linking to the full version. ([Social Media Today][3])
* **Value & tone**: The content should lead with value (e.g., “How to automate job applications with ChatGPT in 5 minutes”) rather than a hard sell. Authenticity and helpfulness are key. ([funnel.io][4])
* **Supporting copy**: Use the post caption on LinkedIn to tease the video’s key benefit, ask a question to invite comments, mention relevant hashtags (#JobSearchAutomation, #AIRecruiting, etc.), and tag maybe one or two influencers or companies.
* **Call to Action (CTA)**: At the end of the LinkedIn-post video or in the post text include a CTA: “Watch the full walkthrough on YouTube”, “Download the checklist”, “Let me know your biggest challenge in comments” etc.
* **Interactivity**: After posting, respond to comments quickly, ask follow-up questions, and encourage discussion—this signals LinkedIn’s algorithm that the post is generating conversation. ([Social Media Dashboard][1])

If you like, I can **draft a week-by-week LinkedIn content rollout plan** (with timeline, post formats, and checklists) that supports these OKRs for your video. Would that be helpful?

# ChatGPT Job Search Automator - Repository Information

## Summary
This repository implements a holistic, structured workflow framework for the ChatGPT Job Search Automator project. Rather than traditional application code, it uses a seven-folder organizational system that guides development from goal-setting through validation, combining project management principles with engineering best practices.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a methodical 7-folder framework representing a complete development journey:

### Main Repository Components
- **1_Real**: Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) - Project goals, success criteria, KPIs, and business constraints
- **2_Environment**: Roadmap & Use Cases - Strategic direction, milestones, user stories, and setup guides  
- **3_UI**: Knowledge & Skill Acquisition - Design patterns, architectural concepts, research notes, and learning documentation
- **4_Formula**: Guides & Best Practices - Code templates, style guides, snippets, and configuration templates
- **5_Symbols**: Implementation & Code - Core application source code (Vite + React template structure) and implementation artifacts
- **6_Semblance**: Error Logging & Solutions - Error logs, root cause analysis, known issues, and debugging guides
- **7_Testing**: Validation & Quality Assurance - Unit/integration tests, test plans, QA documentation, and performance results

## Repository Type
**Type**: Non-traditional organizational framework repository  
**Purpose**: Development workflow and knowledge management system  
**Primary Language**: Markdown documentation  
**Build System**: None (documentation-based framework)

## Key Resources
**Main Documentation Files**:
- README.md (root) - Overview and usage instructions for the 7-folder system
- 1_Real/okr.md - Project objectives and key results
- 1_Real/README.md - OKR structure and templates
- 2_Environment/chatgpt.md - ChatGPT-specific environment configuration
- 2_Environment/README.md - Roadmap and use case structure
- Each folder contains a README.md with detailed purpose, content guidelines, and folder templates

**Directory Organization**:
- Each folder maintains independent README.md files documenting templates and structure
- Documentation uses markdown format for accessibility and version control compatibility
- Structure designed for team collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Usage & Operations
**Workflow Process**:
1. Start in 1_Real to define clear, measurable project objectives and success criteria
2. Consult 2_Environment to establish roadmap, milestones, and implementation phases
3. Use 3_UI and 4_Formula as reference libraries for learning and coding standards
4. Implement features in 5_Symbols following established patterns and guidelines
5. Document errors, root causes, and solutions in 6_Semblance for continuous learning
6. Write and execute tests in 7_Testing to validate changes against objectives

**Key Operations**:
- **Planning**: Define objectives and roadmaps before development
- **Development**: Reference patterns, templates, and guidelines during implementation
- **Learning**: Document new concepts and discoveries in knowledge bases
- **Problem-Solving**: Log errors and maintain searchable solutions database
- **Validation**: Test all changes against project objectives and requirements

## Validation & Quality Assurance
**Quality Approach**:
- Objectives-driven development - all work traced back to measurable OKRs
- Pattern-based consistency - reusable templates ensure uniform code quality
- Documentation requirements - errors and solutions must be logged and analyzed
- Test-first validation - tests must verify alignment with stated objectives

**Testing Structure**:
- Unit tests and integration tests for core functionality
- Manual test plans and test cases for feature validation
- End-to-end testing for user workflows
- Performance testing for optimization verification
- Test coverage documentation and reporting

## Integration Points
This repository serves as:
- **Planning hub**: Centralized project objectives and roadmap
- **Knowledge repository**: Persistent learning and pattern library
- **Issue tracking**: Logged errors and solutions for future reference
- **Quality baseline**: Reference standards and best practices
- **Implementation guide**: Templates and examples for consistent development
